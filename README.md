When you first run this program, it will ask you for your Reddit keys & Account info.<br>
The program will use this to interact with Reddit & automatically post.

     - **Client ID**: It's the long code line under "personal use script".
     - **Client Secret**: It's the long code line next to "Secret".
     - **User Agent**: You can whatever in here (e.g., "MyRandomAgent44")
     - **Username**: The name of the Reddit Account that you want to make a post from.
     - **Password**: The password of the Reddit Account that you want to make a post from..

Both Username & Password have to be from the same account that you made the keys for.



The type of posts you can make
------------------------


- Text post üìÉ

Meaning, a post with a title and content body of only text<br>
You have to write the body of the post (not the title) in the "Text_Post" file<br>
Once you do this the program will make a copy and save it in "user_text"<br>

This is because you may want to schedule 2 text posts, you can safely erase the content<br>
of the "Text_Post" file after you have scheduled a post.<br>

Don't delete the "Text_Post" file or the file in "user_text" folder

------

- Image post üì∑


You need to place the image you want to upload in the "reddit_images" folder<br>
It is recommended for the image name to be simple, like "cat.jpg"<br>
It is extremely important that you use the image extension, not only the name.<br>

If the image is named "cat" then see if it's "cat.jpg" or "cat.png"<br>
You need to write it fully Ex: "cat.jpg" for the program to recognize it.

Once you set up the scheduled post, don't remove the image from "reddit_images"

- Link Posts üß≤

This kind of posts are the ones you do when you want to submit a Youtube video<br>
