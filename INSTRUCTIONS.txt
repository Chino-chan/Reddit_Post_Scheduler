@Reddit-Post-Scheduler


How to use this tool:
---------------------

1) Get "keys" for the Reddit account you want to make a post from
2) Know what "keys" mean 
3) See the type of posts you can make
4) How to cancel an scheduled post


IMPORTANT:
----------

- Once you set up an scheduled post you can not move the folder to another directory.
This is because how it is programmed to be executed by the Windows Task Scheduler. 
if you move the folder it will not find the files. 

- This will only work if, and only if, your computer is turned on at the moment you have
decided to schedule the post. This is because it has to be executed by Windows the Task Scheduler.
if your computer is turned off/sleeping then the Windows Task scheduler will not do its work.

------

1) Text post

Meaning, a post with a title and content body of only text
You have to write the body of the post (not the title) in the "Text_Post" file
Once you do this the program will make a copy and save it in "user_text" 

This is because you may want to schedule 2 text posts, you can safely erase the content
of the "Text_Post" file after you have scheduled a post.

Don't delete the "Text_Post" file or the file in "user_text" folder

------

2) Image post


You need to place the image you want to upload in the "reddit_images" folder
It is recommended for the image name to be simple, like "cat.jpg"
It is extremely important that you use the image extension, not only the name.

If the image is named "cat" then see if it's "cat.jpg" or "cat.png" 
You need to write it fully Ex: "cat.jpg" for the program to recognize it.

Once you set up the scheduled post, don't remove the image from "reddit_images"

3) Link Posts

This kind of posts are the ones you do when you want to submit a Youtube video
a news article or etc. It has to be full complete link, such as
